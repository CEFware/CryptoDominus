### Dominus ###
http://dominusgame.net

Dominus is a multiplayer browser strategy game.  Players grow in power by attacking another player's castle.  Conquering someone's castle makes them your vassal.  Vassals send their lord 25% of their income.  If everyone in the game is your vassal or a vassal of your vassal then you are the Dominus.

Dominus is a slow strategy game that is designed to not require a lot of time to play.  Army movement and resource gathering happen slowly over time.  Login, give your armies their orders then check back in a few hours.

The game is able to support any number of people.  As more people join the map grows creating a larger gameplay space.

Dominus is made using the web platform <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor.js</a>.

### Known Issues ###

* The battle package has some issues still.  I believe the problem is defender.enemies and attackers[0].enemies should not be a reference.  It causes a Maximum call stack size exceeded error.
* Issues are tracked at https://bitbucket.org/daniel_phillips/gridgame/issues?status=new&status=open and should probably be moved to github.
